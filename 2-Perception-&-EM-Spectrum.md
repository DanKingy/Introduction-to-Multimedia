# Electromagnetic Spectrum

<img src="Images/Types-of-Electromagnetic-Radiation.jpg" style="zoom:80%;" />

* Radio waves have long wave lengths and low energy
* Gamma rays have short wave lengths and high energy

* Visible light is one component of many waveforms in the electromagnetic spectrum (400-700nm)

* All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light



# Light

Light is measured in terms of its:

* Radiance (watts) - Total energy emitted
* Luminance (lumens) - Light strength perceived by the human eye
* Brightness - Subjective measure of how bright it appears to be



# Colour Vision

The retina contains two sorts of light receptor cells:

* Rods (~120 million)
  * Detects shades of black and white
  * In the peripheral vision
  * Work in low light - night vision
* Cones (~6 million)
  * Sensitive to colour
  * Mainly central
  * Works with bright light
  * Sensitive to 3 general bands of electromagnetic radiation (red, green, blue)



# Colour

* Most colours can be made by combining different amounts of Red, Green and Blue light
* Active sources such as monitors produce colours by emitting different wavelengths of light
  * Active displays emit combinations of Red, Green and Blue (RGB) light
* Passive sources such as printed documents produce colours by absorbing wavelengths and reflecting others
  * Passive displays have the colours Cyan, Magenta and Yellow (CMY)



# Colour Sensitivity

* The eye is not equally sensitive to all colours
* The eye is more sensitive to Green, then Red, and then Blue
* Human eyes respond to more factors than just dominant wavelength
  * Luminance/Brightness - intensity of light
  * Saturation - how pure the colour is / how much the colour is diluted by white light
  * Chromaticity/Hue - purity and dominant frequency



# Digital Images

* Digital images are often referred to as bitmaps
* The more pixels, the higher the resolution, the better the quality
* Image resolution determines the quality and the storage requirements



# Aspect Ratio

* Expresses the resolution of an image
  * Number of horizontal pixels x vertical pixels
* HDTV - 1920 x 1080
* 4K - 3840 x 2160

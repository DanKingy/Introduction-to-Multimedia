# The World Wide Web

* Client-Server system
* Web resources identified by ULR that are accessible over the Internet
* Resources are transferred via HTTP, and are usually accessed by users through a web browser
* Invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989



# Web Fundamentals

* Pages are defined by HTML
* Most important elements of web pages are hyperlinks to other resources on the same server
* Links allow progression from one page to another and comprise of two parts:
  * Visible link or anchor
  * Target of link, described by a URL



# HTTP

* Stateless protocol (it does not maintain connection information)
* Protocol for communication over the Internet
* Client opens a TCP connection to the Web Server and sends a HTTP header that includes:
  * GET, PUT, POST 
  * Authentication information
  * Cookies
* Server transmits a reply header back to the client, along with any data



# Cookies

* State information is achieved via cookies
* A piece of text that a web server can store on the client-side
* Pieces of information saved as name-value pairs
  * User-ID | DK10098DK
* When requesting access to a server, your browser will look on your machine for a cookie to that website
* If one exists, your browser will send all name-value pairs to the server along with the URL request
* If none exist, the server knows you have not visited before and will create a new cookie
* E-commerce websites use cookies for their shopping carts



# Third Party Cookies

* Cookies have important implications for the privacy and anonymity of web users
* A web page may contain images or other components stored on servers in other domains
* Cookies that are set during retrieval of these components are called third-party cookies
* Advertising companies use third-party cookies to track a user across multiple sites
* An advertising company can track a user across all pages where it has placed advertising images
* This allows the company to target adverts to the user's presumed preferences



# HTML

* Hyper Text Markup Language
* File format for the Web
* Text-based
* Informs the web browser how to construct a page



# XHTML

* Extensible Hyper Text Markup Language
* Conforms to XML syntax
* Stricter than HTML
* Extensive set of existing XML tools can be used



# HTML5

* New major version of HTML
* Includes features such as video playback, drag-and=drop that have previously required browser plug-ins such as Flash

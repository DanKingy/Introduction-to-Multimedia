# The Internet

* An interconnected set of networks

* Billions of computers, all linked together

* Home computers are linked to the Internet using a phone line and a modem through their Internet Service Provider (ISP)

* A computer in a business/university has a Network Interface Card (NIC) that directly connects it to a Local Area Network (LAN)

  * The business then connects the LAN to an ISP

* Every device connected to the Internet must have an IP address, whether it's a host or web server etc.
* Each computer connected will have a 32 bit IP address

  * 256 x 256 x 256 x 256 = 4.3 Billion



# URL

* Uniform Resource Locator
* Each IP address is linked to a URL (vice versa) and a lookup table (DNS) is required to match the two
